# Kiera McCormick

## About Me
I am a senior at Loyola University Maryland majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and am set to graduate in May 2025. I also am involved in the Women's Club Lacrosse team, the Loyola Honors Program, Physics tutoring, the Society of Women Engineers, and more. My research/work focuses on the development of Large Language Models for higher scientific research, human and AI comparsion on Natural Language Processing tasks, advancing open-source science, and more. 

## Experience
This past summer, I participated in the [Annual Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/2024-jelinek-summer-workshop-on-speech-and-language-technology/) led by John Wu at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute. I was placed on a team of twelve computer scientists, astronomers, and psychologists to develop and evaluate an LLM chatbot specialized for astronomy research. My main contribution was in the generation aspect of creating these astronomy-focused LLMs. I worked on developing the best possible LLM-powered chatbots to be hosted and deployed in Slack, concentrating on prompt engineering, open/closed source model comparisons, and more. I also worked on evaluating the quality of these chatbot responses by creating a dataset of “Gold Answers” by expert astronomers, and using LLMs to compare and assign relevance scores between the generated response and the “Gold Answer” response.
