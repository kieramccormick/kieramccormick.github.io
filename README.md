## Kiera McCormick
Hi! My name is Kiera McCormick and I am a senior at Loyola University Maryland majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I will be graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Science and Engineering in May 2025. I also am involved in the Women's Club Lacrosse team, the Loyola Honors Program, Physics tutoring and TAing, the Society of Women Engineers, the Haig Scholars program, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and more. My research and work focuses on the development of Large Language Models for higher scientific research, human and AI comparison and cooperation on Natural Language Processing tasks, advancing open-source science, prompt engineering, question-answer chatbot applications, and more. I am interested in exploring the possibilities of machine learning for interdisciplinary fields, and machine translation. [Please view my CV here!](./KieraMcCormickCV.pdf)

## Experience
This past summer, I participated in the [Annual Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/2024-jelinek-summer-workshop-on-speech-and-language-technology/) led by [John Wu](https://jwuphysics.github.io/) at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute. The goal of this project was to develop and evaluate Large Language Model chatbots meant to assist with astronomy research. I worked on developing the best possible LLM-powered chatbots to be hosted and deployed in Slack, concentrating on prompt engineering, open/closed source model comparisons, and more. I also worked on evaluating the quality of these chatbot responses by creating a dataset of ‚ÄúGold Answers‚Äù by expert astronomers, and using LLMs to compare and assign relevance scores between the generated response and the ‚ÄúGold Answer‚Äù response.

Previously, I completed an internship at [Omega Technical Services](https://omegatechserv.com/) at the [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) in the summer of 2023. I collaborated with the industrial engineering team, focusing on task scheduling optimization through databases and automation, along with interpreting and drawing insights from given data. I also utilized database coding and conducted data analysis using tools such as MicroStrategy, Excel, SQL, Python, and Confluence, contributing to the creation of metrics and dashboards for effective data visualization.
