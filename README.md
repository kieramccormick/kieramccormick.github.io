## About Me
![!](images/headshot.jpg)
Hi! My name is Kiera McCormick and I am a senior at Loyola University Maryland majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I will be graduating with a Bachelor's in Science and Engineering in May 2025. I also am involved in the Women's Club Lacrosse team, the Loyola Honors Program, Physics tutoring, the Society of Women Engineers, and more. My research/work focuses on the development of Large Language Models for higher scientific research, human and AI comparsion on Natural Language Processing tasks, advancing open-source science, and more.

## Experience
This past summer, I participated in the [Annual Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/2024-jelinek-summer-workshop-on-speech-and-language-technology/) led by [John Wu](https://jwuphysics.github.io/) at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute. The goal of this project was to develop and evaluate Large Language Model chatbots meant to assist with astronomy research. I worked on developing the best possible LLM-powered chatbots to be hosted and deployed in Slack, concentrating on prompt engineering, open/closed source model comparisons, and more. I also worked on evaluating the quality of these chatbot responses by creating a dataset of ‚ÄúGold Answers‚Äù by expert astronomers, and using LLMs to compare and assign relevance scores between the generated response and the ‚ÄúGold Answer‚Äù response.

Previously, I completed an internship at [Omega Technical Services](https://omegatechserv.com/) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the summer of 2023. I collaborated with the industrial engineering team, focusing on task scheduling optimization through databases and automation, along with interpreting and drawing insights from given data. I also utilized database coding and conducted data analysis using tools such as MicroStrategy, Excel, SQL, Python, and Confluence, contributing to the creation of metrics and dashboards for effective data visualization.
