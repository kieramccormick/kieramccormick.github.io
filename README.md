Hi! My name is Kiera McCormick, and I am an upcoming Master's student in Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University with a concentration in Human Language Technology. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Science and Engineering in May from Loyola University Maryland. My degree specialized in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I also was involved with the Women's Club Lacrosse team, the Loyola Honors Program, Physics tutoring and TAing, leading the Society of Women Engineers, the Haig Scholars program, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and more. I was recently a finalist for the Choudhury Sarkar-Dey Medal and an academic all-American in the Women's Club Lacrosse Organization. My research and work focuses on the development of Large Language Models for higher scientific research, human and AI comparison and cooperation on Natural Language Processing tasks, advancing open-source science, prompt engineering, evaluating human-computer interactions, question-answer chatbot applications, and more. I am interested in exploring the possibilities of machine learning for interdisciplinary fields, and machine translation. [Please view my CV here!](./KieraMcCormickCV.pdf)

## Experience
This summer, I am working at the [Center for Astrophysics Harvard & Smithsonian](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) with [AstroAI](https://astroai.cfa.harvard.edu/) on Multi-Modal LLMs for Astrophysics. My specific research within this project focuses on prompt engineering, such as creating the best possible prompts to get the most discriminative physical information about ObsIDs listed in the Chandra Source Catalog and SIMBAD, and astronomer validation of LLM-generated summaries through a standard protocol and web interface.

Last summer, I participated in the [Annual Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/2024-jelinek-summer-workshop-on-speech-and-language-technology/) and the [Space Astronomy Summer Program](https://www.stsci.edu/opportunities/space-astronomy-summer-program) led by [John Wu](https://jwuphysics.github.io/) at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute. The goal of this project was to develop and evaluate Large Language Model chatbots meant to assist with astronomy research. I worked on developing the best possible LLM-powered chatbots to be hosted and deployed in Slack, concentrating on prompt engineering, open/closed source model comparisons, and more. I also worked on evaluating the quality of these chatbot responses by creating a dataset of ‚ÄúGold Answers‚Äù by expert astronomers, and using LLMs to compare and assign relevance scores between the generated response and the ‚ÄúGold Answer‚Äù response.

Previously, I completed an internship at [Omega Technical Services](https://omegatechserv.com/) at the [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) in the summer of 2023. I collaborated with the industrial engineering team, focusing on task scheduling optimization through databases and automation, along with interpreting and drawing insights from given data. I also utilized database coding and conducted data analysis using tools such as MicroStrategy, Excel, SQL, Python, and Confluence, contributing to the creation of metrics and dashboards for effective data visualization.
